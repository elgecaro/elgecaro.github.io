## Introduction

<img src="assets/images/caroline.jpg" alt="Photo" hspace="20" width="30%" align="right"/> 
My name is Caroline and this is my fourth year studying the Nordic Languages at Helsinki University.
I'm interested in linguistics (especially when it comes to the Swedish language), computer science, geography and also sustainable development.  

I have been studying *Computer Science* as one of my minors, and have also started taking some courses  in *Language Technology*.
Therefore this website will be dedicated for Computer Science and Language Technology-related content.  

[Here is a (fun) version of my CV](elgecaro.github.io/assets/documents/CV.pdf). I have left out the content that I don't whish to show to the whole world (or Internet).
