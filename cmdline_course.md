# Introduction - Command-line Course
The Command-line Course is a course focused on the command-line, which is a 
user interface navigated by textual commands, and how you can use it as a 
tool for linguistics.  

During the course we have been introduced to the Command-line and its different 
commands and properties, for example regarding using and operating the Unix 
command-line, using the command-line for linguistics (regular expressions, corpora etc), 
running and installing programs and using Github. It's also important to 
be able to use google when (not if) something goes wrong. 

Below is a short summary and reflections of the weekly contents and what I learned

## Week 1: Introduction to Command-Line Environments  
The first week of the course contained an introduction to the command-line 
enviroments and its basics commands. The videos also contained some information 
about the different text editors and the file formats.  

I have been using the command-line in some of my earlier courses in computer 
science, but I did still learn some new things even though I already knew the 
basic commands and was familiar to the environment. This week was still a good 
introduction to the course and its topics - especially for someone who hasn't 
used command-line before.

**Example code from the week:**

```
mkdir newDirectory
```
The *mkdir*-command makes a new directory called *newDirectory*.  

```
wget http://www.gutenberg.org/files/215/215-0.txt 
```
The *wget*-command downloads a file, in this case a textfile from the 
gutenberg.org-site. 



## Week 2: Navigating a UNIX System
During the second week we went through a lot about the UNIX System in general,
and the topics were about the filesystem, users and permissions, remote servers 
and processes.  

I learned a lot during this week, since I haven't been familiar with the 
different users and permissions before. I also think its good to know the 
underlying functions of the different processes and how they work.


## Week 3: Corpus Processing
This week's topics showed how you can use the command-line for linguistic 
purpose like corpus processing. 

In the Introduction to Language Technology I got familiar with regular 
expressions, but I still got a better and larger picture of how you can use 
them.


## Week 4: Scripting and UNIX Configuration Files
During this week we worked a lot with variables, the .bashrc file and also 
started looking at scripts and how these can be used. 

I learned a lot during this week since I hadn't been using scripts earlier. 
I also think this week contained a lot of interesting and necessary things that 
will be useful in the future.


## Week 5: Installing and Running Programs
The fifth week was about installing and running different software like Python, 
C and C++. We also got introduced to *make* and the *makefile*, which can be 
used for building projects.  

I think that this week was very interested, and I learned a lot of new things. 
I really liked the idea of make and I think that the makefile is a very good 
think to know and be able to use.


## Week 6: Version Control
This week continued with the installing and running software-theme with Java, 
and the rest of the week was about version control using Git and Github. Git 
is a version control system, whereas github is a software development platform.

Een though I have been using Github for a project before, I learned new things 
during the week. I have earlier just been using the master-branch, but I now 
understand why it's suitable to create new branches for different parts of a 
project etc. 


## Week 7: Final Assignment - Building a Webpages using Github
The Final Assignment of this course was to create and build an  own website  with
different contents. A big part of the assignment was about Jekyll and Github Pages.  

I have been using Github before, but Jekyll was a new experience for me.
